# AGILE_MZ_Heat

This repository was created to list all datasets used for the conference paper for AGILE 2023: 
"Extreme heat alerts and impacts across Mozambique 2016 - 2022: gathering evidence from media articles" 

Dataset 1: Text compiled from media sources 2016-2022 
[Media_HW_data (1).xlsx](https://github.com/carolinamarghidan/AGILE_MZ_Heat/files/10849347/Media_HW_data.1.xlsx)

Dataset 2: Weather station data
Daily maximum temperatures were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center’s (NCDC) daily summaries (GHCN-Daily) archive for 2016 to 10/05/2022. 

This data is openly available through: 
https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/datasearch/daily-summaries). 

The parameters were filled in as follows:
•	What: “maximum temperature” 
•	Where: “Mozambique”

This outputs 17 weather stations, from which 11 were selected to cover each province across Mozambique and which included records available up to May 2022. 
The locations of the selected stations were: Maputo, Xai-Xai, Panda, Inhambane, Chimoio, Beira, Tete, Quelimane, Nampula, Lichinga, and Pemba.
